note these notes are being written far after data was taken since original notes were not very complete.

this test was to create a limit surface for a single microwedge structure using the dual axis force cantilever.  information regarding this test is in lab book 2008_1 pg 52.

trajectories used were 
LS_p85_a00_v20.txt - LS_p85_a90_v20.txt
LS_p90_a00_v20.txt - LS_p90_a90_v20.txt
LS_p95_a00_v20.txt - LS_p95_a90_v20.txt

cantilever used
629A03

now we encounter the problem that the drag value we used in the analysis of 
20080821_sws6_ldp has a different meaning.

this directory was created by branching the master branch and then adding the data.  

what i want to do when i re-analyze this data is use as much of the code i just wrote for the LDP experiment.  so, i'll use plotAllForceTraceLoadDragPull.m to analyze and will attempt to keep it backward compatible.
