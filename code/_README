these scripts create trajectories for and analyze data from the
roxanne dual axis force testing platform.

these are the keys used for dictionaries in the roxanne code.
ideally they are in the form nounAdjectiveUnits.

the labview code uses these keys for its header

norAmp        = normal amplification factor on signal box
latAmp        = lateral amplification factor on signal box
rollAngle     = roll angle of pin (about axis)
pitchAngle    = pitch angle of pin
cantilever    = cantilever number
sample        = name of sample
contactDistance = distance to initial contact in test setup
run             = number of data run/test
temperature = 21.2
cantilever = 529b02
trajectory = LS_p27_d80_vp20_vd20.traj
humidity = 37.8
sample = sws19
date = March 30, 2010 12:06
norAmp = 100

the data file from the labview code also contains

time
voltageForceLateral
voltageForceNormal
voltagePositionX
voltagePositionY

after the data is separated, the data file contains these column headings:

forceLateralMicroNewton
forceNormalMicroNewton
positionLateralMicron
positionNormalMicron

and these additional header tags

the index file
endIndex = 843
startIndex = 1
pulloffAngle = 0.0
<data>

once the data is analyzed, the following headings are used

pulloffAngle  = angle of withdrawal in ldp test
fileName
forceMaxAdhesion
forceMaxShear
forcePreload
dataFileName
