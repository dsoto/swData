- send data directory on command line to parseChaco so i don't have to keep updating the file with directory strings.  use sys.argv[1] to get first argument

- add keybinding to get return key to do OKButton on parseChaco

- refactor separateData.py and put stuff in roxanne

- rewrite analyzeLimitSurface.py to deal with new converted data files

- deal with outputting the pulloff angle and preload force

- change angle to pulloffAngle in separateData, analyzeLS, and index file generation

- run separate force trace plots with pulloff points for sws12 090610

- run color limit surface on sws12 090610

- currently the index file only has startIndex, endIndex, pulloffAngle.  this could be a much richer set of data including the separated filename the preload distance, or others
