cantilever		629a03
sample				sws6

trajectories:
test velocities of 10,20,50,100 um/sec
only pure shear - angle = 0
preload increments of 1 micron from 80-100

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
preloadMicron = [80:1:100];
angleDegree = [0];
angleRadian = angleDegree * pi / 180;
drag = 80;
velocity = [20  10 100 100; ...
						20  20 100 100; ...
            20  50 100 100; ...
            20 100 100 100];
